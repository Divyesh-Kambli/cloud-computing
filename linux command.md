# Basic Command Of Linux
## pwd 
* When you first open the terminal, you are in the home directory of your user. 
* To know which directory you are in, you can use the “pwd” command. It gives us the absolute path, which means the path that starts from the root. 
* The root is the base of the Linux file system. It is denoted by a forward slash( / ). 
* The user directory is usually something like "/home/username".

## ls
* Use the ls command to know what files are in the directory you are in.

## cd 
* Use the "cd" command to go to a directory. 
* For example, if you are in the home folder, and you want to go to the downloads folder, then you can type in “cd Downloads”.

## mkdir 
* Use the mkdir command when you need to create a folder or a directory.
