# Security Group
* AWS Security Groups act like a firewall for your Amazon EC2 instances controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. 
* When you launch an instance on Amazon EC2, you need to assign it to a particular security group.

* After that, you can set up ports and protocols, which remain open for users and computers over the internet.

* AWS Security Groups are very flexible. You can use the default security group and still customize it according to your liking (although we donâ€™t recommend this practice because groups should be named according to their purpose.) 
* Or you can create a security group that you want for your specific applications. 
* To do this, you can write the corresponding code or use the Amazon EC2 console to make the process easier.
